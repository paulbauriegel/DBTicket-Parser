# DB Ticket-Parser

The Script is able to parse a set of tickets for the German railway company (Deutsche Bahn). It's inspired by the [db-ticket-scraper](https://github.com/hedderich/db-ticket-scraper) script, written by hedderich using the pdfquery-Libary.

I did only test this script for my own tickets, it may not work for yours. If so, just open an issue and I will fix it.
